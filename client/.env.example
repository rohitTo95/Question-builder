# Frontend Environment Variables

# Environment (development | production)
# Development uses Vite proxy to localhost:3000
# Production uses Vercel rewrites configured in vercel.json
VITE_NODE_ENV=development

# DEPLOYMENT NOTES:
# 1. For Vercel deployment, set VITE_NODE_ENV=production
# 2. API routing is handled automatically:
#    - Development: Vite proxy to localhost:3000
#    - Production: Vercel rewrites to Render backend (configured in vercel.json)
# 3. No need to set server URL - routing is automatic
# 4. Ensure your backend CORS allows your frontend domain
